Submission for Team Abhiyaan
=====================================

Name:
Keerthi Vasan M

Roll no:
ED21B034

Previous Experience:
I have previous experience only in coding part.

Current PORs:
No PORs currently.

Why I want to work in the team:
* I always wanted to learn computer vision and how robot is controlled and i feel working in the team and doing projects is the best way i can learn these.
* I also want a POR where I can give my best instead of doing multiple PORs and not focussing on everything that properly.
* I was always curious about computer vision and how robots are controlled, I felt how that is possible. Human beings can detect objects but i was 
  fascinated how computer understands that from the video or photos. I was fascinated on how we can move robotic arms in different ways by coding.
* I want to be a part of the competition team and i am ready to give my best to serve the team and bring it to its next level.
